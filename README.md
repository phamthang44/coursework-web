# Student Question Posting System

A CRUD web application designed for students to post coursework-related questions, engage in peer discussions, and collaborate under administrative oversight. Built as part of the COMP1841 Web Programming 1 coursework at the University of Greenwich, this project leverages PHP, MySQL, and modern web technologies to create a student-focused platform inspired by Quora and Stack Overflow.

## Features

- **Public Post List**: View a list of questions/posts with titles, authors, module tags, and comment/vote counts.
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, read, update, and delete posts, with support for image uploads (e.g., screenshots).
- **User Management**: Signup and login system, with a ban mechanism toggling user status (active/banned) instead of deletion.
- **Voting System**: Upvote posts and comments to highlight valuable content.
- **Comment System**: Full CRUD for comments under each post, fostering discussion.
- **Module Management**: Admins can add, edit, and delete module names, assignable to posts via dropdowns.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage posts, modules, and users, including banning capabilities.
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly retrieve posts by keywords.
- **Accessibility**: Adheres to WCAG 2.1 with semantic HTML and high Lighthouse scores (Accessibility: 95).
- **Security**: Password hashing with PHP’s `password_hash()`, XSS prevention with `htmlspecialchars()`, and session-based authentication.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5 (semantic tags), Tailwind CSS (responsive design), JavaScript (dynamic features like modals and fetch API).
- **Backend**: PHP 8.x with PDO for secure database interactions, MVC architecture, and custom routing.
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0, designed in 3NF with 8 tables (e.g., `users`, `posts`, `modules`, `postvotes`).
- **Tools**: XAMPP (local development), VS Code, Git.
